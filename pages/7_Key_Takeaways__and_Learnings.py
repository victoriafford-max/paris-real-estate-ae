**Manual Uploads Slow Pipeline and Increase Risk of Error**	

:toolbox:    The main weakness of our ETL pipeline is the manual uploads involved at multiple steps in the pipeline. 

:white_check_mark:    To ensure consistency, there are checkpoints along the way were necessary data uploads are flagged.

:bulb:    Looking forward, one solution would be to integrate the entire pipeline into Snowflake (which was not possible with a trial account).

**Joining Geographic Data**

:toolbox:    One significant challenge we faced is how to integrate geographic data into our schema. Since the relationships between variables are spacial, a traditional primary key / foreign key relationship isn't applicable.

:white_check_mark:     Since the scope of our project didn't require a full geospatial schema, our hybrid star model sufficed.
