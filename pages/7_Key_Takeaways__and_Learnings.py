        * The main weakness of our ETL pipeline is the manual uploads involved at multiple steps in the pipeline. 
        * To ensure consistency, there are checkpoints along the way were necessary data uploads are flagged.
        * Looking forward, one solution would be to integrate the entire pipeline into Snowflake (which was not possible with a trial account).

        <span style="color:#6b7280; font-size:0.9rem;">
        * One significant challenge we faced is how to integrate geographic data into our schema. Since the relationships between variables are spacial, a traditional primary key / foreign key relationship isn't applicable.
        * Since the scope of our project didn't require a full geospatial schema, our hybrid star model sufficed.
        * Looking forward, if the further development of a geospatial layer is key aspect of the analysis, working with PostgreSQL and PostGIS would be a more suitable option.
