* **The most expensive arrondissements don't necessarily have more green spaces**: This suggests that location and centrality are stronger price drivers, while green spaces provide useful additional context.
* **High property prices follow high reference rent values when accounding for room number**: The high demand, short supply of small, 1-room units in the city translates to higher prices in both the sale and rental markets.   
* **Owners hold smaller properties in popular areas**: Properties with higher reference rents tend to have lower transaction volumes. In the case of 1-room properties, this may reflect a preference for holding onto smaller units rather than selling them.

        <p>🛠  The main weakness of our ETL pipeline is the manual uploads involved at multiple steps in the pipeline. 
        <p>✅  To ensure consistency, there are checkpoints along the way where necessary data uploads are flagged.
        <p>💡  Looking forward, one solution would be to integrate the entire pipeline into Snowflake (which was not possible with a trial account).

        <br>
        <p>🛠  One significant challenge we faced is how to integrate geographic data into our schema. Since the relationships between variables are spacial, a traditional primary key / foreign key relationship isn't applicable.
        <p>✅  Since the scope of our project didn't require a full geospatial schema, our simplified hybrid star model sufficed.
        <p>💡  To further develop the geospatial layer, one could create a non-relational database for the geospatial table elements. Along with other providers, Snowflake also supports storing and querying geospatial formats.
